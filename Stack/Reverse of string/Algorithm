Algorithm of reverse.c

Initialization:

1. Define a constant MAX as the maximum size of the stack.
2. Declare an array stack[MAX] to store characters.
3. Initialize top to -1 to represent an empty stack.

# Step 1: Input the String

1. Input: Read the string str from the user.

# Step 2: Push Characters onto the Stack

1. For each character in the string str from index 0 to length - 1:
    (a)Check if the stack is full:
    (b)If top == MAX - 1, print "Stack Overflow" and stop pushing more characters.
    (c)If not full:
        -Increment top by 1.
        -Set stack[top] = str[i] (push the character onto the stack).

# Step 3: Pop Characters from the Stack to Reverse the String

1. For each position i from 0 to length - 1:
    (a)Check if the stack is empty:
    (b)If top == -1, print "Stack Underflow" (this should not happen in this context).
    (c)If not empty:
        -Set str[i] = stack[top] (pop the character from the stack).
        -Decrement top by 1.

# Step 4: Output the Reversed String

1. Print: The reversed string str.
