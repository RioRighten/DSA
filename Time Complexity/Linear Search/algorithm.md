# Step 1:
1. Start from the first element (index 0) and compare key with each element (arr[i]).
2. Comparing key with first element arr[0]. Since not equal, the iterator moves to the next element as a potential match.

# Step 2:
1. Comparing key with next element arr[1].Since not equal, the iterator moves to the next element as a potential match.

# Step 3:
1. Now when comparing arr[2] with key, the value matches. So the Linear Search Algorithm will yield a successful message and return the index of the element when key is found.
